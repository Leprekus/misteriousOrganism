Personal project that creates a fictional object named pAequor.

The objects return a strand of DNA containing 15 bases. 
With .mutate() they can change a random base. 

.compareDNA() takes as an argument another object to compare the DNA strand. Returns a string containing the percetage of shared DNA and bases. 

willLikelySurvive() returns true if the DNA strand consists up to 60% or more of C or G bases. 

complementStrand() returns a strand that matches the object's strand bases. 

generateObjects() takes in the number of objects that are to be produced and outputs an array of true if theDNA strand is made up of 60% or more of C or G bases. Else outputs false. This represents whether an object is likely to survive or not.
